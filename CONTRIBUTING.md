# Contributing to [directory-import]

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ANIname/directory-import/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ANIname/directory-import/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Code Style

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) along with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to enforce a consistent code style in this project.

## Code Reviews

Every pull request will be reviewed by one of the maintainers. We'll check the changes for the following criteria:

- Code quality and clarity.
- Adherence to the project's existing style.
- The completeness and accuracy of any tests or documentation submitted alongside the code.

If we ask for changes, don't worry, it's a normal part of the process. Please try to address any comments as best you can. If you disagree with a suggestion, or find it hard to make a requested change, let's discuss it and find a solution together.

## Testing

We strive to have robust tests for our code. If you're submitting a bug fix, please add a regression test that shows the bug is fixed. If you're submitting a new feature, please add thorough tests for it. We're using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/uk/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for our testing framework. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm run jest
```

or if you want watch mode:

```bash
npm run jest:watcher
```
